# Type/Code's Front End Challenge


### Installing

To run the app you'll need node and npm. Install whichever way you please, I use homebrew:

```
brew install node
```

Then you will also need to install gulp:

```
npm install -g gulp
```

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - Building and Serving
* [SASS/Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer) - CSS Preprocessor with automatic browser prefixing
